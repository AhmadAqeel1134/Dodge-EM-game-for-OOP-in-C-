A Dodge EM game in C++ to demonstarte concepts of OOP i.e. Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.
The car will auto rotate around the maze layout, you can change positions using WASD keys.
Eat special fruits to get bonus score and to make enemy disappear.
The movement logic have some fault i.e there might be chance of player's car crossing the corners of maze, rest assured game works perfectly well.
To improve movement logic, use change of variable technique i.e every time collision occures, change the movement variable.
